# Spectogram to visualize music

buffer length of 1024 corresponds to 47 fps at 48000 Hz sampling -- totally acceptable

to reserch:
* SLD2 resizable window
* SDL2 coordinate system rescaling with changing size

# TODO

- [ ] Create window
- [ ] Make window re-sizable
- [ ] make visualization function
- [ ] for smooth video, record shorter buffers and "interpolate"
